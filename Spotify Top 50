# For this project, I downloaded Spotify data from Kaggle.
# Then I created a table to insert Spotify data into.
# Finally, I performed analytics on the data using SQL. 


#Creating the table: 
CREATE TABLE BIT_DB.Spotifydata (
id integer PRIMARY KEY,
artist_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_id varchar NOT NULL,
popularity integer NOT NULL,
danceability decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
energy decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
key integer NOT NULL,
loudness decimal(5,3) NOT NULL,
mode integer NOT NULL,
speechiness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
acousticness decimal(6,5) NOT NULL,
instrumentalness text NOT NULL,
liveness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
valence decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
tempo decimal(6,3) NOT NULL,
duration_ms integer NOT NULL,
time_signature integer NOT NULL 
)

#Then I inserted the Spotify Data .csv into the table.

#Next, I explored the data using the following SQL. 


#1. Select all data from the Spotify top 50 list to see what information is avaiable. 
Select * FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata; 
 
 
 #2. Which songs from the top 50 are by Olivia Rodrigo?
Select track_name
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
Where artist_name='Olivia Rodrigo'; 
 
 
#3. What songs are the most popular and danceable, who were they by?
Select artist_name, track_name
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
Where popularity>'80' AND danceability>'0.80';


 #4. What songs were in the top 10?
Select artist_name, track_name
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
Where id<11; 


#5. How many songs in the top 50 had a tempo above 150 and what were they?
Select track_name
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
Where tempo>150;


#6. Which artists and songs had the shortest duration? Limit the list to five. 
Select artist_name, track_name
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
Order By duration_ms asc
Limit 5;


#7. Which artists have multiple top 50 songs, and how many?
Select artist_name, count(track_name)
From BIT_DB.Spotifydata
Group By artist_name
Having count(track_name)>1
Order By count(track_name) desc;


#8. Order the top 50 songs based on popularity.
Select * 
From BIT_DB.Spotifydata
Order By popularity desc;


#9. What is the average danceability of the top 10 songs?
Select avg(danceability)
From BIT_DB.Spotifydata
Where id<11;


#10. What song has the longest duration?
Select track_name, max(duration_ms)
From BIT_DB.Spotifydata;


#11. Select all info from these three artist: Doja Cat, Dua Lipa, and Olivia Rodrigo. 
Select * 
From BIT_DB.Spotifydata
Where artist_name IN ("Doja Cat", "Dua Lipa", "Olivia Rodrigo");


#12. Group the songs based on duration if they are long, average, or short in song lengths. 
Select track_name, duration_ms,
    Case
        When "duration_ms" > 210000 then "Long"
        When "duration_ms" >180000 then "Average"
        ELSE "Short"
    End as "Song_Length"
From BIT_DB.Spotifydata
Order By duration_ms desc; 


#13. Using a subquery, find the songs and artists with the best energy and liveness. 
Select track_name, artist_name
From BIT_DB.Spotifydata
Where artist_name IN(Select artist_name from BIT_DB.Spotifydata 
where energy>='0.8' 
and liveness >='0.2');
